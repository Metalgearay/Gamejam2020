We have some good news, and some bad news…

The good news is that we're almost at the spatial coordinates where a possible colony can be created.

The bad news is, well, we’ve encountered some extraterrestrials. And they aren't too happy about us being there.

I just hope everyone can make it to the end, but if sacrifices need to be made, we'll have to make them. 

We've lost too much to turn back now!
